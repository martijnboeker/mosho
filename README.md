# Mosho
Hackathon project for teaching people how to show certain emotions

The target audience is kids with autism and this app is supposed to train them to master different facial expressions – smile when they’re happy and frown when they’re sad. It uses the Microsoft cognitive services. (The Face API)

# Running the App
If you clone it on a mac, open it in Xamarin and run it on your emulator you can see the first page. You probably can’t see the second page on emulator because there’s a camera field involved there. However, you can use the iOS free provisioning (https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/getting_started/installation/device_provisioning/free-provisioning/) and deploy it to your iPhone.
 
# Using the App
The user can select an emotion they want to learn on the first page. On the second page there’ll be a sample face on top which teaches the kids how they should look like. On the bottom is the camera facing the user. User can click on the camera field and there’ll be a score shown in the middle of the page presenting how good the user’s facial expression was.
